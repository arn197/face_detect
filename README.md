# face_detect

This app is a clone of the TensorFlow Detect demo app which detects objects.
We modified the app to work with a face detection model, which is based on the SSD-MobileNet architecture and trained on the WiderFaces dataset.
The model has a modest size of 27 MB and has just 5.2 million parameters.
It has an average inference time of 1.5s as well as built in tracking.
